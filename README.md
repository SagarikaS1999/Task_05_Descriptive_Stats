# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains the work for **Research Task 05: Descriptive Statistics and Large Language Models**.  
The task involves using a **public sports dataset** (Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse 2024) to challenge a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to answer natural language questions, ranging from basic descriptive statistics to advanced analytics.

The project demonstrates:
- 📊 **Descriptive Statistics** (total games, goals, top scorers)
- 🤖 **Prompt Engineering** to get LLMs to provide meaningful answers
- 🔬 **Advanced Analytical Questions** requiring reasoning and calculations
- 📈 **Visualizations** generated using Python and Matplotlib
- ✅ Documentation of **LLM successes and failures** in understanding the dataset

## 📊 Data Used
The dataset used is **Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse 2024 Season Data**, containing:
- **Team Statistics:** Goals, shots, turnovers, clears, etc.
- **Player Statistics:** Goals, assists, ground balls, draw controls, caused turnovers, etc.

The dataset was converted into **CSV files** for easier analysis:
- `team_statistics.csv`
- `player_statistics_full.csv`

---


## ✅ Questions Covered
- **Basic:** Total games, total goals, top scorers, most assists
- **Intermediate:** Goal contribution %, players under 5 goals, ground ball leaders
- **Advanced:** Shooting accuracy, defensive impact, turnovers, improvement metrics

## 📈 Visualizations
Python scripts produced several key charts:
- **Top 5 Goal Scorers Bar Chart**
- **Goals vs Assists Scatter Plot**
- **Top 5 Goal Contribution Pie Chart**

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Markdown** for documentation
- **ChatGPT** for prompt engineering & LLM Q&A
- **GitHub** for repository management
